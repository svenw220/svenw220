- 👋 Hi, I’m passionate and dedicated to my craft and technologies, and I always go the extra mile for my employers and clients with high-quality software and eager work-ethic.
- I have a decade of software experience mainly developing the back-end with Java and more recently full-stack. I am an expert in algorithms, data-structures, OOP, multi-threading, core Java/Javascript, and best practices.
- I have implemented high-throughput cloud-based REST APIs and standalone web apps. I loves new tech and solving challenges with a focus on agility, fast delivery and re-usability
